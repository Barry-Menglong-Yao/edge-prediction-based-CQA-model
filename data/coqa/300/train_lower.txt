Teary Joe was a boy with a special ability: he could make himself cry in less than a second. <eos> If he disliked something, or things became difficult, Teary Joe would not hesitate to put on a pitiful face and set great big tears running down his cheeks. <eos> In this way he managed to get practically everything he wanted, because no one could resist the pity inspired by his tearful little face. <eos> But one day, Teary Joe met Pipo. <eos> Pipo was asking people in the street for some change, in return for him helping them in any way he could. <eos> Pipo was very poor; he had no home and no family, so he made a living however he could. <eos> Even so, Pipo always had the biggest smiles on his face. <eos> Joe took to Pipo, so he decided to help him out in making some money. <eos> He went over next to Pipo, took off his hat, put it face-up on the ground, and started crying with the most pitiful of expressions. <eos> Ina few minutes, Joe's hat was full of coins and sweets, but when Joe offered all this to Pipo, Pipo declined. <eos> "I prefer deserving what I receive," answered Pipo with his usual smile, "It's much more fun making an effort to get things. <eos> Maybe I haven't gotten everything I've wanted, but I've done a load of interesting things". <eos> Teary Joe didn't answer; he just walked sadly away. <eos> Joe had got everything he wanted, but he'd done practically nothing of interest the whole day. <eos> That evening, having returned home, Joe requested a delicious cake for his supper. <eos> When his mother said no, Joe tried to cry but, remembering Pipo and how joyful he was, he tried to get the cake in some other way. <eos> Joe spent the whole evening helping his mother to water the plants and organize the library books. <eos> In the end there was no cake. <eos> But that wasn't so bad, because Joe discovered it had been much more fun doing all those things that evening rather than just sitting crying to get a piece of cake that, in the end, wouldn't have been worth it. <eos> Where did Teary and Pipo meet?

CHAPTER XX. <eos> FOLLOWING ALLEN. <eos> Hal was astonished to learn from Katie McCabe that Dick Ferris was coming up the tenement stairs. <eos> "He can't be coming here"! <eos> exclaimed the youth. <eos> "What shall we do if he does"? <eos> asked McCabe. <eos> "I don't know. <eos> Perhaps I had better hide. <eos> He may----"   At that instant came a knock on the door. <eos> "It's him"! <eos> whispered Katie. <eos> Andy McCabe, the father, pointed to a closet. <eos> Hal tiptoed his way to it, and motioned for Katie to follow. <eos> The door was closed, and then Andy McCabe answered the summons. <eos> Ferris stood at the door, his hair disheveled and his lips trembling. <eos> "May I ask who lives here"? <eos> he asked. <eos> "My name is McCabe". <eos> "Isn't there a man by the name of Macklin living here"? <eos> went on Ferris. <eos> "Macklin"? <eos> repeated McCabe, slowly. <eos> "Yes, Tommy Macklin". <eos> "Not as I know on. <eos> What does he do"? <eos> "I don't know. <eos> I have a letter to deliver to him. <eos> So you don't know where he lives"? <eos> "No, sir". <eos> "It's too bad. <eos> Will you please tell me what time it is"? <eos> Andy McCabe glanced at the alarm clock that stood on the mantel-shelf. <eos> "Quarter to six". <eos> "As late as that"! <eos> cried Ferris. <eos> "I must hurry and catch him before six. <eos> Only quarter of an hour. <eos> Good-day, sir". <eos> "Good-day". <eos> In a moment Ferris was gone. <eos> McCabe closed the door, and Hal came out of the closet followed by Katie. <eos> "What does he mean"? <eos> questioned the man. <eos> "I'll tell you what it means," said Hal. <eos> "He is trying to prove an alibi, in case a body was found in the vat. <eos> He thinks you can remember he was here looking for Macklin at quarter to six. <eos> If that was true, how could he have helped Macklin at five o'clock"? <eos> who was going to hide?

Microsoft Word is a word processor developed by Microsoft. <eos> It was first released on October 25, 1983 under the name "Multi-Tool Word" for Xenix systems. <eos> Subsequent versions were later written for several other platforms including IBM PCs running DOS (1983), Apple Macintosh running Classic Mac OS (1985), AT&T Unix PC (1985), Atari ST (1988), OS/2 (1989), Microsoft Windows (1989), SCO Unix (1994), and macOS (2001). <eos> Commercial versions of Word are licensed as a standalone product or as a component of Microsoft Office, Windows RT or the discontinued Microsoft Works suite. <eos> Microsoft Word Viewer and Office Online are freeware editions of Word with limited features. <eos> In 1981, Microsoft hired Charles Simonyi, the primary developer of Bravo, the first GUI word processor, which was developed at Xerox PARC. <eos> Simonyi started work on a word processor called "Multi-Tool Word" and soon hired Richard Brodie, a former Xerox intern, who became the primary software engineer. <eos> Microsoft announced Multi-Tool Word for Xenix and MS-DOS in 1983. <eos> Its name was soon simplified to "Microsoft Word". <eos> Free demonstration copies of the application were bundled with the November 1983 issue of "PC World", making it the first to be distributed on-disk with a magazine. <eos> That year Microsoft demonstrated Word running on Windows. <eos> Who did they hire in 1981?

Tony Hawken, 57, is divorcing his wife Xiu Li, 51, Britain's wealthiest woman entrepreneur , because he says he doesn't like being rich and is 'not in the habit' of spending lots of money. <eos> The pair traded up their semi-detached home in South Norwood, London, and bought a PS1. <eos> 5million house in Surrey. <eos> Li, who is now worth $1. <eos> 2billion (PS700million) according to Forbes, quickly settled into a life which included sipping a PS900 bottle of wine on a luxurious yacht. <eos> However, Mr Hawken says he felt more comfortable getting lunch in his local Wetherspoon's. <eos> Despite his sudden wealth he continued to buy books from charity shops, and _ dear clothes. <eos> In an interview with The Times, he said: 'I think it made me uncomfortable because I'm not in the habit, I don't like spending lots of money -- I've been brought up that way. <eos> 'Until recently I was never a wealthy person. <eos> I've been moderately comfortable because I have been careful with my money. <eos> '   Now the couple have decided to part, Mr Hawken will walk away with just PS1million, but says it will be enough for him. <eos> He added: 'I have got a settlement which is not great, but it's enough for me because I don't have an extravagant lifestyle. <eos> I won't have to work if I'm careful. <eos> '   On a recent trip to China, Mr Hawken said his wife took him on a yacht and treated him to a PS900 bottle of wine, but he prefers his local Wetherspoon pub. <eos> 'I'm getting a little pay when you consider her potential wealth, but I don't really want to fight it. <eos> '   Mr Hawken met Li on a blind date while he was still a teacher and she was studying English. <eos> The couple married, but as Li's business took off the couple spent more and more time apart. <eos> Mr Hawken says the couple have spent most of the relationship apart. <eos> Far from driving them apart, Mr Hawken believes the distance kept them together, and says they would have divorced a long time ago if they were under the same roof. <eos> Mr Hawken says his only regret is not getting a divorce sooner, but he didn't push for it over fears it would affect the couple's teenage son William, now 17. <eos> Mr Hawken no longer teaches full-time, but instead gives free tuition to under-privileged children. <eos> How old is Tony Hawken?

Beijing (CNN) -- "Please excuse me, I can't talk about this". <eos> Clunk! <eos> The phone line goes dead. <eos> We had tried to get this British businessman to talk about the mysterious death of Neil Heywood. <eos> Heywood has emerged from the shadows to be a key link in a story of intrigue, mystery and betrayal that goes all the way to the inner sanctum of China's secretive Communist Party. <eos> Heywood was found dead last November in his hotel room in the sprawling southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing. <eos> According to media reports, local authorities quickly ruled his cause of death as "excessive alcohol use". <eos> An autopsy was not performed, media reports said, and his body was cremated. <eos> Slowly, however, media reports are raising more uncomfortable questions about Heywood's death. <eos> He was married to a Chinese woman and had business interests in the country. <eos> He moved in the orbit of a company known as Hakluyt and Co., a British strategic information consultancy formed by former officers of the UK's spy agency MI6. <eos> Hakluyt has released a statement on Heywood, saying, "We had a long history of advising Western companies on China and we are among those who sought (Heywood's) advice. <eos> We are greatly saddened by his death". <eos> Now, the British government is asking China to investigate Heywood's death. <eos> "Our embassy in Beijing and consulate general in Chongqing provided consular assistance to the family, as we would in any case involving a British national overseas," the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said. <eos> "We recently asked the Chinese authorities to investigate the case further after we heard suggestions that there were suspicious circumstances". <eos> Who died?

(EW.com) -- Identity Thief (CinemaScore: B) fared even better than expected, bringing in $36. <eos> 6 million over the weekend across 3,141 theaters. <eos> For comparison, Melissa McCarthy's last major film Bridesmaids (though it was in a supporting role) opened at $26. <eos> 2 million, in 2,918 theaters. <eos> With an opening like this, big things are surely expected from Seth Gordon's R-rated comedy which has already surpassed its $35 million production budget. <eos> Though Bateman and Gordon had a successful run with Horrible Bosses after a $28. <eos> 3 million opening weekend in July 2011, Bateman hasn't had this kind of luck with most of his starring roles. <eos> Universal's The Change-Up (with Ryan Reynolds) opened at $13. <eos> 5 million in August 2011 and went on to gross only $37. <eos> 1 million domestically, on a $52 million production budget. <eos> Jonathan Levine's Warm Bodies took second place for its second weekend with $11. <eos> 5 million, bringing its domestic total to $36. <eos> 7 million. <eos> This breaks Levine's record, beating the lifetime domestic gross of his last feature, the cancer dramedy 50/50 with Seth Rogen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, which brought in $35 million. <eos> The R-rated Hitchcock-style, prescription-drug thriller Side Effects (CinemaScore: B) ended up beating director Steven Soderbergh's January 2012 weekend opening of Haywire, earning $10 million weekend this weekend and averaging $3,845 per theater. <eos> We talked a little bit about stars Rooney Mara and Channing Tatum's box office history yesterday. <eos> Another star of Side Effects is Jude Law, and he's got a varied track record at the box office. <eos> He generally participates in ensemble casts -- Anna Karenina, the Sherlock Holmes franchise, Soderbergh's Contagion, The Holiday -- making his singular box office appeal somewhat more elusive. <eos> Side Effects has Soderbergh's name and another strong ensemble, and could go on to a respectable run, even though it won't reach Contagion heights (the epidemic thriller eventually grossed $76 million). <eos> What is the name of the movie?
Leah and the Big Yellow Dog   Leah was very happy. <eos> It was a bright, sunny day and Mommy was taking her to Leah's favorite place. <eos> Leah loved the play park near the water! <eos> Mommy parked the car and Leah ran out right away and climbed the big slide. <eos> Up she went and then down. <eos> Two other kids saw Leah and ran over and slid down, too. <eos> Leah was laughing and happy. <eos> Suddenly a big, yellow dog walked into the park. <eos> This was really a friendly dog, and only wanted someone to play with. <eos> But Leah was scared of dogs. <eos> Leah didn't see the dog at first. <eos> Leah started walking toward the swing, and the dog followed Leah. <eos> Before Leah sat on the on the swing, she turned around and saw the dog smiling at her. <eos> The dog looked goofy standing there with its mouth open. <eos> Leah was scared. <eos> She started yelling and screaming. <eos> This only made the dog look confused. <eos> The dog then began sounding out with Leah, barking and howling itself. <eos> They were a sight to see with Leah screaming and the dog howling. <eos> Mommy went over and took Leah away from the dog, but mommy could barely keep herself from laughing. <eos> The dog's master came and got the dog, and Leah went back to playing. <eos> "Some dogs are nice," Mommy told Leah. <eos> what did Leah run toward?

(CNN) -- Paris St Germain have completed the signing of Barcelona's Brazilian left-back Maxwell on a three-and-a-half year contract for an undisclosed fee. <eos> The 30-year-old finalized his move on Thursday after passing a medical and agreeing personal terms with the big-spending French league leaders. <eos> Maxwell, who has never made a full international appearance for his country, joined Barcelona from Inter Milan in July 2009, and played 57 La Liga matches for the club without scoring a goal. <eos> Who are football's top January transfer targets? <eos> In his two full seasons with the Catalan giants, Maxwell collected a remarkable 10 trophies; three Spanish Super Cups, two European Super Cups, two League titles, two Club World Cups and one Champions League. <eos> However, he struggled to command a regular place in the Barcelona side, with compatriot Adriano and Frenchman Eric Abidal often selected ahead of him. <eos> PSG sporting director Leonardo told reporters: "We're thrilled, he is a player I have always liked and who plays in the same position that I used to play in -- we have something in common". <eos> Maxwell himself added: "The main motivation for me to come here was the interest that PSG showed in me. <eos> The ambition the club has for the future also persuaded me to join". <eos> Paris St Germain, who appointed Italian Carlo Ancelotti as their new coach late last year and are boosted by funds from their cash-rich Qatari owners, are currently three points clear at the top of the French table. <eos> What sport is the article about?

Wide awake in Aunt Bet's Southern house, Annie Van Lew shivered at the sounds of distant guns. <eos> It was bad enough that America was at war, but the young Virginia girl was not used to battles being fought this close. <eos> _ . <eos> Annie sat up in bed and listened. <eos> Had a stranger broken in? <eos> Earlier, the family had heard that captured officers recently escaped from a prison nearby. <eos> Quietly opening her bedroom door, Annie walked out. <eos> A figure in a black gown was walking down the hall. <eos> It was Aunt Bet, carrying a candle in one hand and a plate of fried chicken in the other. <eos> Annie followed her aunt to a stairway at the far end of the house. <eos> Aunt Bet climbed to the top, and opened a door leading to the attic . <eos> Annie followed closely behind. <eos> In the attic, Aunt Bet stopped at a chest of drawers, moved it aside, and felt along the wall behind it. <eos> Slowly a door sprang open, revealing a hidden room. <eos> A thin man stepped out of the opening. <eos> As Aunt Bet handed him the plate of food, the young man saw Annie in the doorway and froze. <eos> Desperately shaking her head "no", the girl raised one finger to her lips. <eos> The officer understood and shifted his look. <eos> Quickly Annie went back downstairs and hid, waiting until after Aunt Bet left to return. <eos> Back inside the attic,Annie called softly to the man inside, who told her where to find the hidden spring. <eos> Soon the young officer stood in the open doorway. <eos> A small candle burned on a table behind him and, in its soft light, Annie studied his face. <eos> Clear eyes reflected the calm of one who faced death bravely. <eos> Smiling, he said,"What trouble you should have gotten into if your aunt had turned around"! <eos> That night, Annie learned Aunt Bet was one of many daring Southerners whose hatred of slavery drove them to risk their lives by spying for the North. <eos> The girl chatted as she dared, wishing her new friend luck when he said he would leave at dawn. <eos> Back in her room, Annie felt proud and was determined to guard her family's secret to the end. <eos> What made Annie shiver?

Tom and Mike were good friends. <eos> Sometimes they were kind to each other, sometimes they were not. <eos> But all of their classmates said they were like brothers. <eos> One day they went out for a walk together. <eos> At noon they were very hungry and they went into a restaurant to have lunch. <eos> The waiter came up to them and asked,"What can I do for you"? <eos> "Please bring us two apples first". <eos> said Tom. <eos> When the waiter put two apples on the table, Mike took the bigger one at once. <eos> Tom got angry, "You are impolite,Mike. <eos> Why don't you take the smaller one"? <eos> Tom said. <eos> "But I am right". <eos> said Mike with a smile,"if I let you take first, which one will you choose"? <eos> "Of course I'11 take the smaller one. <eos> "said Tom. <eos> "Yes". <eos> Mike said,"If you take the smaller one,the bigger one will still be mine. <eos> Don't you think so"? <eos> "Oh"! <eos> Tom couldn't answer. <eos> Who is Tom's good friend?

CHAPTER I   I SET OFF UPON MY JOURNEY TO THE HOUSE OF SHAWS   I will begin the story of my adventures with a certain morning early in the month of June, the year of grace 1751, when I took the key for the last time out of the door of my father's house. <eos> The sun began to shine upon the summit of the hills as I went down the road; and by the time I had come as far as the manse, the blackbirds were whistling in the garden lilacs, and the mist that hung around the valley in the time of the dawn was beginning to arise and die away. <eos> Mr. Campbell, the minister of Essendean, was waiting for me by the garden gate, good man! <eos> He asked me if I had breakfasted; and hearing that I lacked for nothing, he took my hand in both of his and clapped it kindly under his arm. <eos> "Well, Davie, lad," said he, "I will go with you as far as the ford, to set you on the way". <eos> And we began to walk forward in silence. <eos> "Are ye sorry to leave Essendean"? <eos> said he, after awhile. <eos> "Why, sir," said I, "if I knew where I was going, or what was likely to become of me, I would tell you candidly. <eos> Essendean is a good place indeed, and I have been very happy there; but then I have never been anywhere else. <eos> My father and mother, since they are both dead, I shall be no nearer to in Essendean than in the Kingdom of Hungary, and, to speak truth, if I thought I had a chance to better myself where I was going I would go with a good will". <eos> Where were they leaving?

When we asked Oprah to pick the 10 books she's read in the past decade that have mattered to her most, she was momentarily stumped. <eos> For someone who describes herself as --inspired, challenged, and sustained by books, it was almost impossible for Oprah to stay within our limit of 10. <eos> Still, she offered up the following, but she emphasized that it was only a sampler of delightful titles that have also managed to teach her -- and all of us -- a few things. <eos> 1. <eos> Discover the Power Within You   By Eric Butterworth   256 pages; Harper One   Advice from the internationally known spiritual teacher. <eos> 2. <eos> A New Earth   By Eckhart Tolle   316 pages; Plume   There's a reason Oprah picked this for her Book Club in 2008 -- and that she gave audience members Post-it pens along with their copies. <eos> So much wisdom, so little time! <eos> A real-life guide to living your best life. <eos> 3. <eos> The Poisonwood Bible   By Barbara Kingsolver   576 pages; Harper Perennial   This novel is about a family involved in the political trouble of postcolonial Africa. <eos> It established Kingsolver as one of our wisest observers of history, politics, and human nature. <eos> 4. <eos> Night   By Elie Wiesel   120 pages; Hill and Wang   A memoir of a childhood suffered in concentration camps during the Holocaust. <eos> It's horrific butuplifting. <eos> --I gain courage from his courage,|| Oprah says. <eos> 5. <eos> A Fine Balance   By Rohinton Mistry   624 pages; Vintage   A Dickensian novel about India during the Emergency. <eos> Like the aftermath of September 11, it teaches us about cultures we haven't understood. <eos> "It takes us out of our own little shell and exposes us to a whole other world out there". <eos> Oprah say. <eos> 6. <eos> East of Eden   By John Steinbeck   608 pages; Penguin   This classic is about good and evil as played out in a late-19th-century California ranch family. <eos> If you didn't read it in high school, read it now. <eos> If you did, reread it! <eos> 7. <eos> The Story of Edgar Sawtelle   By David Wroblewski   576 pages; Harper Collins   A kind of Hamlet on the prairie, this is the wrenching story of a mute boy and his dog. <eos> Oprah compares it to East of Eden and To Kill a Mickingbird. <eos> 8. <eos> The Pillars of the Earth   By Ken Follett   973 pages; Penguin   About the challenges of building cathedrals in 12th-century England. <eos> This novel couldn't be more different in setting, time, and plot from the author's breakthrough success, Eye of the Needle. <eos> Oprah declares it simply "great". <eos> 9. <eos> The Bluest Eye   By Toni Morrison   224 pages; Penguin   How to choose among the great Morrison's novel? <eos> Start with this one about a girl who thinks she has to have blue eyes to be beautiful. <eos> Oprah considered it one of the best in a crowded Morrison field. <eos> 10. <eos> The Known World   By Edward P. Jones   400 pages, Harper Collins   When this book was published in 2003, it shocked everybody with its description of slave-owning blacks before the Civil War. <eos> A daring, unusual examination of race. <eos> Whose book club was it?

MaxiCode is a public domain, machine-readable symbol system originally created and used by United Parcel Service. <eos> Suitable for tracking and managing the shipment of packages, it resembles a barcode, but uses dots arranged in a hexagonal grid instead of bars. <eos> MaxiCode has been standardised under ISO/IEC 16023. <eos> A MaxiCode symbol (internally called "Bird's Eye", "Target", "dense code", or "UPS code") appears as a 1 inch square, with a bullseye in the middle, surrounded by a pattern of hexagonal dots. <eos> It can store about 93 characters of information, and up to 8 MaxiCode symbols can be chained together to convey more data. <eos> The centered symmetrical bullseye is useful in automatic symbol location regardless of orientation, and it allows MaxiCode symbols to be scanned even on a package traveling rapidly. <eos> MaxiCode symbology was released by UPS in 1992. <eos> MaxiCode symbols using modes 2 and 3 include a "Structured Carrier Message" containing key information about a package. <eos> This information is protected with a strong Reed-Solomon error correction code, allowing it to be read even if a portion of the symbol is damaged. <eos> These fields include:   The structured portion of the message is stored in the inner area of the symbol, near the bull's-eye pattern. <eos> (In modes that do not include a structured portion, the inner area simply stores the beginning of the message. <eos> What does MaxiCode look similar to?

The Iberian Peninsula , also known as Iberia , is located in the southwest corner of Europe. <eos> The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory. <eos> It also includes Andorra and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula that forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. <eos> With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian. <eos> The English word "Iberia" was adapted from the use of the Ancient Greek word Ἰβηρία by Greek geographers under the rule of the Roman Empire to refer to what is known today in English as the Iberian Peninsula. <eos> At that time, the name did not describe a single political entity or a distinct population of people. <eos> Strabo's 'Iberia' was delineated from Keltikē (Gaul) by the Pyrenees and included the entire land mass southwest (he says "west") of there. <eos> The ancient Greeks reached the Iberian Peninsula, of which they had heard from the Phoenicians, by voyaging westward on the Mediterranean. <eos> Hecataeus of Miletus was the first known to use the term "Iberia", which he wrote about circa 500 BC. <eos> Herodotus of Halicarnassus says of the Phocaeans that "it was they who made the Greeks acquainted with. <eos> . <eos> . <eos> Iberia". <eos> According to Strabo, prior historians used "Iberia" to mean the country "this side of the Ἶβηρος" as far north as the river Rhône in France, but currently they set the Pyrenees as the limit. <eos> Polybius respects that limit, but identifies Iberia as the Mediterranean side as far south as Gibraltar, with the Atlantic side having no name. <eos> Elsewhere he says that Saguntum is "on the seaward foot of the range of hills connecting Iberia and Celtiberia". <eos> What country has an overseas territory on the peninsula

Why Are Pig Farmers Still Using Growth-Promoting Drugs? <eos> It's one of the most controversial practices in agriculture: feeding small amounts of antibiotics to animals in order to make them grow faster. <eos> But what if the drugs don't even work very well? <eos> There's some good evidence that they don't, at least in pigs. <eos> They used to deliver a boost in growth, but that effect has disappeared in recent years or declined greatly. <eos> The reason for this is interesting and even paradoxical. <eos> Researchers think the antibiotics used to work by suppressing low-grade infections. <eos> In recent years, however, pork producers found other ways to accomplish the same thing through improved hygiene . <eos> As a result, the drugs have become largely superfluous -- yet many farmers still use them. <eos> To understand how this happened, you have to step back in time, says Steve Dritz, a specialist in pig nutrition at Kansas State University. <eos> Sixty years ago, when antibiotics were new, "people started treating animals, and feeding [the antibiotics], and finding that they had increased growth rates and feed efficiencies," he says. <eos> Nursery-age pigs, for instance, grew 12 to 15 percent faster with antibiotics. <eos> The animals also needed less feed to reach full weight. <eos> Other studies showed similar results in chickens and cattle. <eos> In the 1980s, a new set of studies found similar effects. <eos> So the growth-promoting effects of antibiotics became standard practice among meat producers. <eos> Fast forward to the 1990s. <eos> Dritz was starting his career as a scientist at Kansas State University, and pork production was changing dramatically. <eos> Previously, pigs were born and raised in one barn or in several barns close together. <eos> This meant infections could easily pass from one generation to the next, the way that kids share germs between their friends on the playground and their parents at home. <eos> Under the new system, when piglets are weaned, they move to a whole different place. <eos> That new site is carefully scrubbed and free of disease. <eos> Craig Rowles, who runs a large swine operation in Carroll, Iowa, shows me one such room. <eos> There's not a piglet in sight. <eos> "This room just got completely washed and disinfected, and now it's going to sit here and dry for a while," he says. <eos> A whole group of pigs will come in here together, and later they will move out together to yet another site. <eos> "That group of pigs will stay together until they go to market," Rowles says. <eos> The groups are kept strictly separated from each other. <eos> If workers move between the groups, they first have to change their boots. <eos> When farmers adopted multisite production, it cut down on disease -- and pigs actually grew faster. <eos> Who specializes in pig nutrition?

Have you ever tried broccoli ice cream? <eos> That's what Oliver serves his customers in the new movie Oliver's Organic Ice Cream. <eos> The one-minute film was created by kids. <eos> A film is a movie. <eos> The young students learned their moviemaking skills at the Jacob Burns Film Center. <eos> The center is in Pleasantville, New York. <eos> Kids who go there learn how to make movies and music videos. <eos> The character Oliver and his treats are animated. <eos> In an animated movie, objects, such as ice cream and paper dolls, appear to be alive or moving. <eos> Animated movies are made up of hundreds of pictures. <eos> It takes 15 pictures to make just one second of film. <eos> To make a movie that lasts one minute, students need to take about 900 frames. <eos> A frame is a picture. <eos> Animation expert Joe Summerhays teaches kids the steps to shoot a movie. <eos> He says what they learn behind the scenes, however, also counts. <eos> Students create their films in small groups. <eos> They have to agree on every decision. <eos> " The benefit of the class is less animation and more problem-solving," Summerhays said. <eos> "It's all about teamwork". <eos> About 4,000 kids have made movies at the Jacob Burns Film Center. <eos> Mikey Price, 11, of Briarcliff Manor, New York, is one of them. <eos> "I'm actually making a real movie," he said. <eos> "It's an adventure". <eos> where are kids learning about movie making?

CHAPTER IV   THE CHASE ON THE LAKE   "He means to give us as much of a chase as possible," remarked Tom, as he glanced over his shoulder. <eos> "If I remember rightly, Baxter was always a pretty fair oarsman". <eos> "Yes, that was the one thing he could do well," returned Dick. <eos> "But we ought to be able to catch him, Tom". <eos> "We could if we had two pairs of oars. <eos> One pair can do just about so much and no more". <eos> "Nonsense! <eos> Now, both together, and put all your muscle into it," and Dick set a stiff stroke that his brother followed with difficulty. <eos> Baxter had been rowing down the lake, but as soon as he saw that he was being pursued he changed his course for the east shore. <eos> He was settled to his work, and for several minutes it was hard to tell whether he was holding his own or losing. <eos> "Hurrah! <eos> we are catching up"! <eos> cried Dick, after pulling for five minutes. <eos> "Keep at it, Tom, and we'll have him before he is half over". <eos> "Gosh, but it's hot work"! <eos> came with a pant from Tom Rover. <eos> "He must be almost exhausted to row like that". <eos> "He knows what he has at stake. <eos> He sees the prison cell staring him in the face again. <eos> You'd do your best, too, if you were in his place". <eos> "I'm doing my best now, Dick. <eos> On we go"! <eos> and Tom renewed his exertions. <eos> Dick set a faster stroke than ever, having caught his second wind, and the rowboat flew over the calm surface of the lake like a thing of life. <eos> Who said He means to give us as much chase as possible?

(CNN) -- Armed renegade soldiers walked through Mali's damaged presidential palace on Thursday, hours after the troops' leaders claimed to have ousted the West African nation's democratically elected leader. <eos> Shell casings, bullet-ridden cars and shattered windows were evident in video from outside the palace, as well as at least one burned-out room inside. <eos> And there was no sign of or indication of what happened to President Amadou Toumani Toure, with the military group's apparent leader Capt. <eos> Amadou Sanogo saying little about him beyond that he was "safe". <eos> Still, within much of Mali on Thursday night, the situation appeared to be relatively calm as most people appeared to have abided by coup leaders' call for a nighttime curfew. <eos> Amadou Konare, a spokesman for the troops behind the apparent coup, asked citizens to return to their jobs Friday, though he gave no timetable as to when Mali's borders would reopen. <eos> Earlier Thursday, Konare was among a group of soldiers wearing fatigues who said on television that they had suspended the constitution and dissolved public institutions because of the government's handling of an insurgency. <eos> "Considering the incapacity of the regime in effectively fighting against terrorism and restoring dignity to the Malian people, using its constitutional rights, the armed forces of Mali, along with other security forces, have decided to take on their responsibilities to put an end to this incompetent regime of President Amadou Toumani Toure," said Konare. <eos> Surgeons told an aid worker -- who asked to remain anonymous -- that 29 people who had been injured as a result of the recent unrest were in Bamako's main hospital, while another nine were in a medical facility in Kati, about 18 kilometers (11 miles) to the northwest. <eos> What were some things to be seen not in the palace?

The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States, along with the Republican Party. <eos> Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's Democratic-Republican Party, the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson, making it the world's oldest political party. <eos> The Democrats' dominant worldview was once social conservatism and economic liberalism, while—especially in the rural South—populism was its leading characteristic. <eos> In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt ran as a third-party candidate in the Progressive ("Bull Moose") Party, leading to a switch of political platforms between the Democratic and Republican Party and Woodrow Wilson being elected as the first fiscally progressive Democrat. <eos> Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s, the Democratic Party has also promoted a social-liberal platform, supporting social justice. <eos> Today, the House Democratic caucus is composed mostly of progressives and centrists, with a smaller minority of conservative Democrats. <eos> The party's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality, along with the welfare state. <eos> It seeks to provide government intervention and regulation in the economy. <eos> These interventions, such as the introduction of social programs, support for labor unions, affordable college tuitions, moves toward universal health care and equal opportunity, consumer protection, and environmental protection form the core of the party's economic policy. <eos> The party has united with smaller liberal regional parties throughout the country, such as the Farmer–Labor Party in Minnesota and the Nonpartisan League in North Dakota. <eos> When was the Democratic party founded?

In many countries, schools have long summer holidays, with shorter holidays in between. <eos> However, a new report suggests shortening school holidays to stop children forgetting what they have learnt during the long summer break. <eos> Instead of three school terms, it says, there should be five eight-week terms. <eos> And there should be just four weeks off in the summer, with a two-week break between the other terms. <eos> Sonia Montero has two children at primary school and works full-time. <eos> She supports the idea". <eos> The kids," she says, " have much longer holidays then and I can't afford to take several weeks off work, so I need someone to take care of them. <eos> But nobody wants the work in the summer holidays -- they all have holidays of their own. <eos> Not surprisingly, some young people disagree. <eos> Student Jason Panos says , "It's a stupid idea. <eos> I would hate staying at school in the summer. <eos> It's unfair, too. <eos> The people who suggest this had long school holidays when they were young, but now they want to stop us enjoying the summer. <eos> The kids in Spain and American have much longer holidays than here, but they don't forget everything they've learnt in a few months". <eos> Nadia Salib agrees". <eos> Sure," she says, "the first week at school after the summer is never easy, but you soon get back into it. <eos> The real problem round here is that kids get bored after so many weeks out of school, and then some of them start causing trouble. <eos> But the answer is to give them something to do, not make everyone stay in school longer". <eos> What has long holidays
