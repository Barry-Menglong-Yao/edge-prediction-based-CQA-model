there is experimental evidence that cortical neurons show avalanche activity with the intensity of firing events being distributed as a power-law . <eos> we present a biologically plausible extension of a neural network which exhibits a power-law avalanche distribution for a wide range of connectivity parameters . <eos> How old is she?

experimental data indicate that norepinephrine is critically involved in aspects of vigilance and attention . <eos> previously , we considered the function of this neuromodulatory system on a time scale of minutes and longer , and suggested that it signals global uncertainty arising from gross changes in environmental contingencies . <eos> however , norepinephrine is also known to be activated phasically by familiar stimuli in welllearned tasks . <eos> here , we extend our uncertainty-based treatment of norepinephrine to this phasic mode , proposing that it is involved in the detection and reaction to state uncertainty within a task . <eos> this role of norepinephrine can be understood through the metaphor of neural interrupts . <eos> Why does she laugh?
